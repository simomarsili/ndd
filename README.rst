The **ndd** package provides a simple Python interface to an efficient
implementation of the `Nemenman-Schafee-Bialek (NSB) algorithm
<https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0108025>`_,
a parameter-free, Bayesian entropy estimator for discrete data.
The NSB algorithm allows entropy estimation in strongly undersampled cases,
where the number of samples is much smaller than the number of classes with
non-zero probability.

The figure shows the average bias vs the number of samples for the NSB
estimator, the "plugin" or maximum-likelihood estimator and an estimator
proposed in `Grassberger 2003 <https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0307138>`_
(Eq. 35). Check the figure [details]_.

Basic usage
===========

The **entropy** function takes as input a vector of **frequency counts**
(the observed frequencies for a set of classes or states) and an **alphabet size**
(the number of classes with non-zero probability, including unobserved classes)
and returns an entropy estimate (in nats)::

  >>> import ndd
  >>> counts = [12, 4, 12, 4, 5, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 4, 12, 12, 1, 2]
  >>> entropy_estimate = ndd.entropy(counts, k=100)
  >>> entropy_estimate
  2.840012048914245

Where to get it
===============
Install using pip::

  pip3 install -U ndd

or directly from sources in github for the latest version of the code::

  pip3 install git+https://github.com/simomarsili/ndd.git

In order to compile **ndd**, you will need **numpy** (>= 1.9) and a
**Fortran compiler**  installed on your machine.
If you are using Debian or a Debian derivative such as Ubuntu,
you can install the gfortran compiler using the following command::

  sudo apt-get install gfortran

On Windows, you can use the gfortran compiler from the
`MinGW-w64 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files>`_ project
(`direct link <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download>`_
to the installer).

If you don't have a Fortran compiler, install using the
`ndd python wheels <https://github.com/simomarsili/ndd-wheels>`_
with pre-compiled extensions. numpy >= 1.16 is needed.

Changes
=======

**v1.6.1**
   Changed:
   Fixed numerical integration for large alphabet sizes.

**v1.6**
   Changed:

   The signature of the *entropy* function has been changed to allow
   arbitrary entropy estimators. The new signature is::

     entropy(pk, k=None, estimator='NSB', return_std=False)

   The available estimators are::

     >>> import ndd
     >>> ndd.entropy_estimators
     ['Plugin', 'MillerMadow', 'NSB', 'AsymptoticNSB', 'Grassberger']

   Check the function docstring for details.

   Added:

   - *MillerMadow* estimator class
   - *AsymptoticNSB* estimator class
   - *Grassberger* estimator class

**v1.5**
    For methods/functions working on data matrices:
    the default input is a **n-by-p** 2D array (n samples from p discrete
    variables, with different samples on different **rows**).
    Since release 1.3, the default was a transposed (**p-by-n**) data matrix.
    The behavior of functions taking frequency counts as input
    (e.g. the *entropy* function) is unchanged.
**v1.4**
    Added the *kullback_leibler_divergence* function.
**v1.1**
    Added:

    * *from_data*
    * *mutual_information*
    * *conditional_information*
    * *interaction_information*
    * *coinformation*
**v1.0**
    Drop support for Python < 3.4.
**v0.9**
    Added the `jensen_shannnon_divergence` function.

.. [details] The bias is averaged over 1000 vectors of counts extracted
       from a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution with alphabet size k = 10^4
       for two different values of the concentration parameter alpha,
       0.1 and 10.0, corresponding to average entropies of approx.
       0.8 and 0.99, respectively. Logarithm base is k (the alphabet size).
