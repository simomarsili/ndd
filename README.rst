The **ndd** package provides a simple Python interface to an efficient
implementation of the `Nemenman-Schafee-Bialek (NSB) algorithm
<https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0108025>`_,
a parameter-free, Bayesian entropy estimator for discrete data.
The NSB algorithm allows entropy estimation when the number of samples is much
smaller than the number of classes with non-zero probability.


Basic usage
===========

The **entropy** function takes as input a vector of **frequency counts**
(the observed frequencies for a set of classes or states) and an **alphabet size**
(the number of classes with non-zero probability, including unobserved classes)
and returns an entropy estimate (in nats)::

  >>> import ndd
  >>> counts = [12, 4, 12, 4, 5, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 4, 12, 12, 1, 2]
  >>> entropy_estimate = ndd.entropy(counts, k=100)
  >>> entropy_estimate
  2.8400090633157338

The uncertainty in the entropy estimate can be quantified using the
posterior variance (see Eq. 13 in `Archer 2013
<https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/pubs/Archer13_MIestim_Entropy.pdf>`_)
that is computed efficiently using a multiplicities-based implementation::

  >>> entropy_estimate = ndd.entropy(counts, k=100, return_std=True)
  >>> entropy_estimate
  (2.8400090633157338, 0.10884841403552914)

Where to get it
===============
Install using pip::

  pip3 install -U ndd

or directly from sources in github for the latest version of the code::

  pip3 install git+https://github.com/simomarsili/ndd.git

In order to compile **ndd**, you will need **numpy** (>= 1.9) and a
**Fortran compiler**  installed on your machine.
If you are using Debian or a Debian derivative such as Ubuntu,
you can install the gfortran compiler using the following command::

  sudo apt-get install gfortran

On Windows, you can use the gfortran compiler from the
`MinGW-w64 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files>`_ project
(`direct link <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download>`_
to the installer).

If you don't have a Fortran compiler, install using the
`ndd python wheels <https://github.com/simomarsili/ndd-wheels>`_
with pre-compiled extensions. numpy >= 1.16 is needed.

Changes
=======

**v.1.8.3**
   Fixed:

   integration for huge cardinalities

**v1.8**
   Added:

   full Bayesian error estimate (from direct computation of the posterior
   variance of the entropy)

**v1.7**
   Changed:

   estimation is much faster (removed unnecessary checks on input counts)

   `entropy()` function needs cardinality `k` for the default (NSB) estimator

**v1.6.1**
   Changed:
   Fixed numerical integration for large alphabet sizes.

**v1.6**
   Changed:

   The signature of the *entropy* function has been changed to allow
   arbitrary entropy estimators. The new signature is::

     entropy(pk, k=None, estimator='NSB', return_std=False)

   The available estimators are::

     >>> import ndd
     >>> ndd.entropy_estimators
     ['Plugin', 'MillerMadow', 'NSB', 'AsymptoticNSB', 'Grassberger']

   Check the function docstring for details.

   Added:

   - *MillerMadow* estimator class
   - *AsymptoticNSB* estimator class
   - *Grassberger* estimator class

**v1.5**
    For methods/functions working on data matrices:
    the default input is a **n-by-p** 2D array (n samples from p discrete
    variables, with different samples on different **rows**).
    Since release 1.3, the default was a transposed (**p-by-n**) data matrix.
    The behavior of functions taking frequency counts as input
    (e.g. the *entropy* function) is unchanged.
**v1.4**
    Added the *kullback_leibler_divergence* function.
**v1.1**
    Added:

    * *from_data*
    * *mutual_information*
    * *conditional_information*
    * *interaction_information*
    * *coinformation*
**v1.0**
    Drop support for Python < 3.4.
**v0.9**
    Added the `jensen_shannnon_divergence` function.
